**[Splide](https://splidejs.com/) is a lightweight, powerful and flexible slider and carousel, written in pure JavaScript without any dependencies.**

## Why? (https://github.com/Splidejs/splide/pull/296)
This temporary project fixes the "window is not defined" error when using SSR. When the original package is patched this package and repository will be deprecated.
